- We needed to create a Marvel database so that fans could find interesting facts and have fun.
- Why did I build this project? I built this project to supplement a bigger project. We wanted to include a quiz for fans to play on the site.

- This project primarily builds up skills for the developers in managining Third-Party APIs and CSS framerworks. Other skills involve: JavaScript, jQuery, Google Fonts, and GitHub branches.
